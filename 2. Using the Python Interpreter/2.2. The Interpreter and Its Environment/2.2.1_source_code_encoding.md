# 2.2.1. Source Code Encoding

有可能使用`ASCII`在Pyton的檔案中。最好放行一個特別的指令在`#!`的右邊去定義檔案的編碼：

```Python
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```
在宣言後文件中的所有字符將被視為具有編碼的編碼，它會直接用 Uniconde 編寫成你所選的編碼。編碼列表可以在`Python Library`找到。

For example, to write Unicode literals including the Euro currency symbol, the ISO-8859-15 encoding can be used, with the Euro symbol having the ordinal value 164. This script, when saved in the ISO-8859-15 encoding, will print the value 8364 (the Unicode code point corresponding to the Euro symbol) and then exit:
```Python
# -*- coding: iso-8859-15 -*-

currency = u"€"
print ord(currency)
```
If your editor supports saving files as UTF-8 with a UTF-8 byte order mark (aka BOM), you can use that instead of an encoding declaration. IDLE supports this capability if Options/General/Default Source Encoding/UTF-8 is set. Notice that this signature is not understood in older Python releases (2.2 and earlier), and also not understood by the operating system for script files with #! lines (only used on Unix systems).

By using UTF-8 (either through the signature or an encoding declaration), characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals and comments. Using non-ASCII characters in identifiers is not supported. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
